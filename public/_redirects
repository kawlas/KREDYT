# SPA/History Fallback - If a file exists, serve it. If not, serve catch-all (404 page)
# But since we prerendered specific routes, they exist. 
# Anything else is likely a 404 or dynamic route.

# If we had dynamic routes (e.g. /offer/:id) we would need:
# /offer/*  /index.html  200

# For now, just standard 404 for unknown
/* /index.html 404
